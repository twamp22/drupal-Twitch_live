# drupal-Twitch_live

* This is some PHP for Drupal that I have written to embed one(randomly) of the user's twitch streams.
* If no Drupal users are live on Twitch, show one of the top Twitch channels.
*
* This script gets all available Twitch account channels from HybridAuth using Drupal's user entity.
* If any of those channels are live, it will randomly select one to embed.
* If no Drupal users are live on Twitch, show one of the top Twitch channels.
