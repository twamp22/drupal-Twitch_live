# drupal-Twitch_live

This is some PHP for Drupal that I have written to embed one(randomly) of the user's twitch streams.

This script gets all available Twitch account name from the custom user profile field (field_twitch_channel). If any of those accounts are live, it will randomly select one to embed. If no user streams are live, it will embed twitch.tv/twitch.
